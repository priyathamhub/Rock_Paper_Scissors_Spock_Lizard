 							GAME RULES
ROCK :
In the old version, rock smashes scissors, period. 
However, in the new and improved version rock smashes scissors, and rock smashes lizard.

PAPER :In the old game paper covers rock. 
That's about it. Now, in the new game paper covers rock, and paper disproves Spock.

SCISSORS :Scissors cuts paper. 
Pretty standard rules, Right? Nope! Now scissors cuts paper, and also decapitates (cuts the head off of) lizard.

LIZARD :No picture for this one so I'll explain the hand gesture. 
Hold your hand as if you were holding a sock puppet, with your thumb under all of your other fingers. 
That is the gesture for lizard. Boom. But what does lizard do? Lizard eats paper and poisons Spock.

SPOCK : Last but not least, Spock. Spock can, like every other gesture, beat two other gestures. 
First, Spock vaporizes rock. Second, Spock smashes scissors.
